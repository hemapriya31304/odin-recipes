<h4>Method</h4>    
<p> 
    Marination process
    <ol>
    <li>Make the marinade by mixing yogurt, ginger, garlic, turmeric, red chili powder, garam masala, salt, mint leaves, and lemon juice.
    <li>Add chicken and coat evenly with the marinade. Keep in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. You can marinate the chicken overnight too.
    <li>While the chicken is marinating, rinse and drain the rice 2 to 3 times, then soak in water for 20 minutes.
    <li>marinade ingredients in a bowl
    <li>While the rice is soaking, add ghee to a heavy-bottomed pan and add onions.
    <li>On medium heat, fry the onions stirring frequently until they start to turn golden brown - about 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the fried onions from the pan, leaving the excess ghee behind as we will use this pan to cook the chicken.            
    </ol>

    <ol>
    <li>Parboil the rice</li>
    <li>In a medium pot add 8 cups of water. Add cumin seeds, bay leaves, star anise, cardamom, cloves, and salt to the rice and bring the to a boil on high heat.</li>
    <li>Drain the soaked rice and add it to the boiling water. Bring the rice to a full boil on high heat. Lower the heat to medium and cook uncovered for 5 to 6 minutes or until the rice is about 90% cooked. Drain the rice promptly and reserve.</li>
    <li>Cook the chicken and layer the rice</li>
    <li>To the pan with the remaining ghee, add the marinated chicken. Cook on medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes, turning halfway through.</li>
    <li>Then, gently layer the partially cooked rice over the chicken</li>
    <li>Top with caramelized onions and saffron-infused milk.</li>
    <li>Cover the pot and seal it with aluminum foil, then place some weight on top of the lid. Cook on low heat for 20 minutes, this is the steam or "Dum" cooking step. </li>
    <li>Turn the heat off and wait another 10 minutes before opening the pot.</li>
    </ol>

<p>Serving
Serve Biryani hot with some yogurt, lemon wedges, and a cooling cucumber raita or beet raita. Pair it with Mango Lassi or Rose Lassi for a satisfying meal. Want to know my favorite dessert to pair with Biryani - its hands down the Gajar Halwa or Rice Kheer.</li>
