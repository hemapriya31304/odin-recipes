<h2>Strawberry cheese cake</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This strawberry cheesecake is a crowd-pleaser every time I make it! Rich, sweet, and creamy cheesecake filling surrounded by a buttery, crisp graham cracker crust and then loaded with a bright, beautiful strawberry sauce…it is the perfect summer dessert! Serve it with a dollop of whipped cream for added indulgence.</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>

<p>
    Cheesecake Biscuit Base:
    <li>200g / 7oz Arnott’s Marie crackers or other plain biscuit (Aus) or 28 Graham Cracker squares (Note 1)</li>
    <li>120 g / 8 tbsp unsalted butter , melted</li>
</p>

<p> Cheesecake Filling:
    <li>1 lb / 500g cream cheese , softened (Note 2)</li>
    <li>2 tbsp plain flour (all purpose flour)</li>
    <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sour cream (full fat, sub sour cream)</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups caster sugar (superfine sugar)</li>
    <li>Zest of 1 lemon</li>
    <li>3 eggs , at room temperature</li>
</p>

<p>Strawberry Topping for Cheesecake:

    <li>500g / 1 lb strawberries , half diced and half halved</li>
    <li>2 tbsp lemon juice OR water (Note 3)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tsp cornflour/cornstarch</li>
    <li>2 tbsp water</li>
</p>

<h5>Method</h5>
<p>
    
    <ol>
    <li>the graham cracker crumbs and sugars, then stir in the melted butter.</li>
    <li>Press the mixture into the bottom and up the sides of a springform pan. Try to get the crust as high up the sides as possible–this will help prevent cracks. Set this aside while you prepare your filling.</li>
    <li>Cheesecake Filling</li>
    <li>Beat the cream cheese and sugar until smooth, creamy, and well combined. Use a spatula to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl to make sure everything is incorporated, then stir in the sour cream and vanilla.</li>
    <li>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing only until just combined after each.</li>
    <li>Pour the mixture into your prepared springform pan and bake at 325F for 45-50 minutes or until the cheesecake is mostly done, but the center is still jiggly.</li>
    <li>Remove the cheesecake from the oven and let it sit at room temperature until it no longer warm to the touch. Transfer the cheesecake to the fridge to chill for at least 6 hours, or if possible, overnight.</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    Strawberry Topping
<ol>
<li>Whisk together the sugar and cornstarch in a small saucepan, then add the water, lemon juice, and half of the strawberries. Turn the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring constantly.</li>
<li>Remove the sauce from the heat once the berries have broken down and the sauce begins to thicken.</li>
<li>Stir in the butter and remaining berries until combined, then pour into a heatproof bowl to cool. You can place this in the fridge to speed up the cooling process.</li>
<li>Spoon the cooled topping over the chilled cheesecake, slice, and serve.</li>
</ol>
